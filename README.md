# EDMN
Neural Network based Distribution Matching for Multiclass Quantification

Quantification is the task of estimating the class distribution in an independent dataset. Quantifying multiclass
data sets remains a challenging problem. To address this, a
novel two-step quantification framework, EDMN, is proposed for
multiclass settings. In the first step, well-calibrated class prob-
ability outputs are generated by an Enhanced Artificial Neural
Network (EANN) that is trained specifically for quantification.
In the second step, these outputs are refined using Enhanced
Distribution Matching (EDM), a novel quantification method
based on the distribution matching paradigm and interclass
conditional probabilities. Experiments carried out on 58 binary
and multiclass datasets demonstrate that the proposed EDMN
method achieves a higher quantification performance compared
to existing methods, showing particularly strong performance in
multiclass settings.
